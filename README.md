It is my first normal program in python. (I'm from Ukraine and I didn't make translate, so language is Ukrainian).

I made this program for coin collectors. There you can create collections and add coins into it. You also can input price for all coind and on analitic menu you can find graph
of prices from start to today. I also made parser script in file parser_script.py, so you can find actuall prices for all Ukrainian coins. Program saves all data to json files.
file data.json contains today date, list of Ukrainian coins their prices and file collections_list.json include information about your collections and your coins.

compilated program's size is about 60 mb
